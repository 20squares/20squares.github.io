    <h1>Internship position</h1>
    <h2>Quantum cryptography</h2>

      <code>Our ideal intern, Linda, fiddling with ordered affine partition functions.</code>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p>
          <code>Why:</code> In recent times, <a href="https://github.com/The-QSig-Commission/QSigCommissionWiki/wiki/Quantum-1%E2%80%90Shot-Signatures">quantum 1-shot signatures</a> have received increased interest from the blockchain research community, as this esotheric cryptographic gadget is the key to achieve amazing feats such as consensus protocols with perfect finality.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this reason, together with other researchers we created <a href="https://github.com/The-QSig-Commission/">the QSig Commission</a>, an organization devoted to further investigate the topic. It is our goal to transform quantum 1-shot signature into a feasible piece of technology as soon as possible.
        </p>

      </li>

      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p>
          <code>What: </code>
          We already drafted a <a href="https://github.com/The-QSig-Commission/q1ss">first implementation</a> of an <a href="https://github.com/The-QSig-Commission/QSigCommissionWiki/wiki/Hash-functions-from-ordered-affine-partitions">ordered affine partition hash function</a>, which is the most fundamental theoretical advancement underlying quatum 1-shot signatures.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem is that this function is not cryptographically secure at the moment, and will need to be obfuscated in some way. With our support, you will learn the basics of quantum computing and assess the feasibility of hardening ordered affine partition hash functions through obfuscation.
        </p>

        <p>Key Responsibilities:<br>
          <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <code>Understand</code> how ordered affine partition hash functions work. These functions are classical, so working knowledge in quantum computing is not strictly needed. 
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <code>Investigate</code> state of the art cryptographic obfuscation techniques, and assess their usefulness in our context.
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <code>Produce</code> technical results (either theory or code) around obfuscating ordered affine partition hash functions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>This internship has the following benefits:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Competitive remuneration.
            </li>
            <li>
              In-depth exposure to the latest developments in a leading applied research ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opportunity to establish a career foothold in different industries and their overlaps - especially cryptography, quantum computing and blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opportunity to publish your results in academic journals and to present them at relevant conferences if they are promising enough.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opportunities for further work within 20[ ].
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p>
          <code>Who: </code>
            We are looking for a candidate with a strong skillset in cryptography, and in particular around cryptographic obfuscation techniques, demonstrated through past projects or relevant coursework in mathematics/computer science.
        </p>

        <p>We particularly value independent, self-directed work ethic.</p>
        
        <p>
          Knowledge in quantum computing is very much appreciated, but not required. If you have no previous knowlege in quantum computing, you will have some basic proficiency in it by the end of this internship.
        </p>

        <p>
          Proficiency in Python, Julia, or similar languages (evidence through project examples or GitHub repositories) is a plus, but not strictly required.
        </p>

        </p>

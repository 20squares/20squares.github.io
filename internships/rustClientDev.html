      <code>Our ideal intern, Mallory, neck deep into rust.</code>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p>
          <code>Why:</code>
          Because we want to better our understanding of the inner workings of blockchain tech from a low-level perspective, and because we like rust very much.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p>
          <code>What:</code>
          Your job will be mainly focused on studying blockchain client implementations in rust, with a particular focus on Ethereum (<a href="https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth">reth</a>).
        </p>

        <p>Key Responsibilities:<br>
          <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <code>Understand</code> how <a href="https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth">reth</a> works, and to what extent it is modularized.
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <code>Investigate</code> how much the client architecture is dependent on underlying, low level protocols. For instance, how feasible would it be to switch the underlying P2P communication protocol from <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/">Kademlia</a> to something else?
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
              <code>Produce</code> valuable code contributions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>This internship has the following benefits:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Competitive remuneration.
            </li>
            <li>
              In-depth exposure to the latest developments in a leading blockchain ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opportunity to establish a career foothold in the blockchain industry.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opportunities for further work within 20[ ].
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p><code>Who: </code>
          Our ideal candidate has 3+ years of experience in Rust, is quick-witted and willing to learn/pick up new stuff.
        </p>

        <p>We particularly value independent, self-directed work ethic.</p>
        
        <p>
          Previous experience with blockchain development and Ethereum protocol development in particular is a big plus, but not strictly necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          Proficiency in other languages commonly used in blockchain client dev (e.g. go) is a plus, but not required.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p>
          <code>When:</code>
          The duration of this project is from April 2024 until August 2024, with an expected average of 2-3 days of work per week.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may decide to extend this internship for longer or to promote it to something more substantial if we are satisfied enough and our resources permit it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <p>
          <code>Where:</code>
          This is a fully remote internship. You do not have to move.
        </p>

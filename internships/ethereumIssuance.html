        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: none;">
            <p><code>Why:</code>
            As of late, there's <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/electra-issuance-curve-adjustment-proposal/18825">ongoing discussion</a> about fiddling with Ethereum's issuance curve. This is a delicate topic that is directly intertwined with Ethereum centralization, with the economics and business viability of solo stakers, LSTs, and liminal actors, and with the dynamics of restaking.</p>

            <p>The proposed changes to the issuance curve could potentially take place as soon as September 2024. This is very soon for Ethereum standard and has taken many people by surprise. We think this is an important topic and we want to have a clearer vision of what's going on.</p>
          </li>

          <li style="list-style-type: none;">
            <p><code>What: </code> With our support, you will analyze the current proposals for changes of the issuance curve of Ethereum's native token, and model/simulate their effect on various actors, such as solo stakers, liquid and restaking providers.</p>

            <p>The expected outcome of the project is an actionable report together with a model that helps the Ethereum community to discern between alternative proposals.</p>

            <p>Key Responsibilities:<br>
            <ul>
              <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <code>Analyze</code> current proposals for changes to the Ethereum token issuance curve.
              </li>
              <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <code>Model and simulate</code> the effects of these changes on the business viability of solo staking. We are also interested in understanding how this impacts liquidity providers and restaking providers, but that has less priority. You will likely need to work with historical data, which we will provide.
              </li>
              <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <code>Create</code> an actionable and comprehensive report to assist the Ethereum community in evaluating alternative proposals.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

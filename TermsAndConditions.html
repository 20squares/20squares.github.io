                <li>Project coordination.</li>
            </ul>
            Each WP shall be executed and delivered on behalf of each of the parties hereto. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any WP and this Document, the terms and conditions of the WP shall govern. 20[ ] fully agrees to perform such obligations to the best of its ability, and with competence and diligence, for the sole benefit of the Company.
        </li>
        <li>
            20[ ] shall be responsible for the supervision and direction of the work by its consultants and independent contractors. 20[ ] will inform Company of the name of the individual responsible for supervising the provision of the Services and the identities of the entities or individual executing the Work Package. 
        </li>
        <li>
            20[ ] acknowledges and agrees that the Work Package is a project of first impression and requires original and unique solutions which may or may not be successful in certain respects. 20[ ] acknowledges and agrees that any failure as to any particular aspect of the required Deliverables, in the absence of negligence, shall not constitute a material breach of the Agreement and WP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Except as otherwise provided herein, the services provided pursuant to the Work Package are provided “AS IS” with all faults and without warranty of any kind. 20[ ] makes no representations or warranties as to the quality, suitability, availability, reliability, security, performance or adequacy of the services, and 20[ ] makes no express, statutory or implied representations or warranties, at law or in equity, including, without limitation warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, title, non-infringement, quiet enjoyment, no encumbrances, system integration, accuracy, workmanlike effort and warranties. No oral or written information or advice given by 20[ ] or its authorized representatives shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope or 20[ ]'s obligations.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Acceptance of Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
            A Deliverable shall be deemed to have been accepted by Company as soon as practicable, and if necessary on a phased basis, as may be specified in the Work Package in accordance with the following procedure: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Company shall have ten (10) days from the date a Deliverable is furnished to determine if it conforms to the applicable WP;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Within such ten (10) day period, Company shall either acknowledge that the Deliverable is accepted, or refuse to accept such Deliverable by providing a written specification in detail the manner in which the Deliverable does not meet the applicable specifications;
                </li>
                <li>
                    If 20[ ] agrees that the Deliverables do not meet the applicable specification or acceptance criteria, it thereafter shall have fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as the parties may agree) to take corrective steps. If Company fails to provide within (10) days a written notice of acceptance following the final submission of the Deliverable, the Deliverable shall conclusively and for all purposes be deemed to have been accepted and the pertinent portion of the Work Package deemed satisfied.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Should Company assert that the Deliverables do not meet the applicable specifications or acceptance criteria, as specified in the Work Package, the disagreement shall be submitted to arbitration as stated herein.
        </li>
        <li>
            In performing their respective obligations hereunder, the parties shall cooperate fully to enable 20[ ] to provide satisfactory Services and Deliverables that meet the applicable specifications and acceptance criteria, and to otherwise fulfill all requirements of the WP.

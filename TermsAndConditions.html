                    20[ ] acknowledges that the Company is in the business of the development, marketing and sale of decentralised applications for blockchain technologies, and related items and services, and that the particular needs of the Company and the Company’s customers are not generally known in the industry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the term of the Engagement, the Company and 20[ ] may have access to and become familiar with various trade secrets and confidential information of each other. For the purposes of these Terms, "<strong>Confidential Information</strong>" means any confidential or proprietary information identified in writing as confidential or proprietary that is disclosed by either party to the other during the term of the Engagement, whether of a technical, business, or other nature (including, without limitation, writings, trade secrets, know-how, and information relating to technology, business plans, promotional and marketing activities, finances, and other business affairs of the parties). Confidential Information will be marked as such and may be contained in tangible materials, such as writings, drawings, models, data, specifications, reports, compilations, and computer applications. Both parties acknowledge that Confidential Information is proprietary information constituting trade secrets, has independent economic value, and is and shall continue to be owned solely by the disclosing party, which retains all right, title, and interest therein and thereto. No licence is granted hereunder to the Confidential Information delivered or made available to the other party, or to any intellectual property right therein.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During and following the termination of the engagement for any reason, both parties agree not to use, and not to permit anyone under their supervision to use, such Confidential Information, and not to reveal or divulge such information to any person other than persons to whom the disclosing party has given its prior written consent, except as properly required in the course of the receiving party's discharge of its duties hereunder for the benefit of the disclosing party and its customers and prospective customers. 20[ ] hereby agrees to execute from time to time any separate declaration of confidentiality in a form reasonably required by any customer or prospective customer of the Company in connection with the Company’s business or operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions of this section shall be inoperative as to such portions of information which otherwise would constitute Confidential Information which
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            are or become part of the public domain other than as a result of the disclosure thereof by 20[ ] in breach of these Terms;

                        <li>
                            which were already in the possession of 20[ ] prior to disclosure to it by the Company, as evidenced by 20[ ]’s contemporaneous written records;

                        <li>
                            which are disclosed to 20[ ] by third parties which do not have a fiduciary relationship or other obligation of confidentiality with the Company; or
                        </li>
                        <li>

Should a Force Majeure event last more than thirty (30) days, either party may terminate the Engagement by written notice to the other party.

                    We will use our best efforts to resolve through informal, good faith negotiations any dispute, claim or controversy relating to these Terms or relating to the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of the arbitration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to <code>legal[at]20squares[dot]xyz</code> so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we are not able to reach an informal resolution within 60 days of your email, then either of us may bring proceedings in mediation, binding arbitration or to the competent courts in Germany.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You and we agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in individual capacity only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and we expressly waive the right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.

                <li>
                    Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes amicably, we may bring an action in any applicable court to protect our intellectual property rights (“<strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong>” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). We may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the event of any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms, the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of Germany. Any such dispute or claim shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The parties further acknowledge and agree that any legal action or proceeding relating to these Terms may only be brought in such courts and waive any objection they may have to the jurisdiction of such courts on the grounds of venue or inconvenience of forum.
